# Configuration

Configuration is handled through the Home Assistant UI.

1.  Navigate to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**.
2.  Click **+ ADD INTEGRATION**.
3.  Search for **Family Bell**.
4.  Follow the on-screen prompts in the setup wizard:
    *   **TTS Provider:** Select your preferred Text-to-Speech engine from the dropdown list (e.g., `tts.google_en_com` or `tts.piper`). This determines which service will be used to generate the announcements.
    *   **Voice/Language:** (Optional) If your chosen TTS provider supports different voices or languages, you can specify that here.

You can change these settings at any time by navigating to the integration's card in **Settings** > **Devices & Services** and clicking **Configure**.
